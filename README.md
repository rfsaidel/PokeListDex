# PokeListDex
Project for my nephew! <br>
Pokedex based on [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/) <br>
Feel free to commend and copy this code!

Main purpose of this project is to learn and implement new Android features!
Current expectation is to achieve: 
- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM pattern
- Dagger or Koin injection (not necessary yet)
- API communication
